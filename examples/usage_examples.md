# Directory of catmap Usage Examples

Select a user below to learn more about the specific roles that are relevant to them within our application. 

## [Doctor](users/doctor.md) 
As a clinician you are either using catmap to study visualizations of cancer gene data or using it to embed data collected from patients you interact with.

## [Patient](users/patient.md) 
As a patient you are using catmap either to learn more about cancer by looking at the visualization or working with your oncologist to view and interpret how your specific data fits into the catmap.

DNA sequencing is not often used in cancer diagnosis, and the scientific community relies on tissue sample donations in order to advance this technology. Patients who donate their tissue samples are helping improve this area of research and diagnosis by providing additional data and insights for applications such as catmaps. 


## [Public Health Official](users/public_health.md) 
As a public health official, such as a policymaker or researcher, you are using catmap to learn about cancer at a population level. This is done by using the filtering options available in the application to stratify the data by demographic information or health outcomes. You will likely not have access to additional data from individual patients that could be uploaded into the model, so you will not need to work with the embedding features of the application. 

## [Maintainer](users/maintainer.md) 
As a maintainer, you would keep the catmap application running and respond to bug reports. You would need to update the model based on new data to improve accuracy.
