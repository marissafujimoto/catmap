Click the links below to learn more about how to use the catmap application for each of the individual use cases applicable to your role. 

As a patient, we expect that you may have some interest in learning more about catmaps and how the data they display relates to your specific type of cancer. To learn more about how to interact with and interpret our application, please click the link below.

We do not expect patients to have access to their data or be able to embed it into the model themselves, but we do anticipate that they may work with their oncologists to see how their own data would be embedded into the model. Therefore, we still provide patients with an explanation of how the embedding and interpretation of new data works.

DNA sequencing is not often used in cancer diagnosis, and the scientific community relies on tissue sample donations in order to advance this technology. Patients who donate their tissue samples are helping improve this area of research and diagnosis by providing additional data and insights for applications such as catmaps. We hope that doctors and patients will work together to advance this area of research.
