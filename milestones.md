**Milestones:**

1.  Get access to data

2.  Download from the study webpage

3.  Confirm that we can pull the data into python

4.  Manipulate/filter data to better understand it

5.  Demonstrate embedding models and test different ones

6.  Start with single dataset - non-small cell lung cancer

7.  Build model for this dataset

8.  Create basic plots to view the embedding

9.  Create a UI for the app Framework comparisons, see what fits the
    data best and looks most visually appealing

10. Demonstrate that we can plot points in the UI (sanity test that all
    features are working)

11. Create a polished version of the plotted embedding

12. Test how well we can predict the mapping for a single user based on existing data

**Timeline (4 weeks (5-10 hours a week per person)):**

Feb 20th:

-   Understand our data: what are itâ€™s dimensions / annotations.

-   Make sure we feel good about additional annotations (more than just
    patient label)

-   IDE setup (vscode / colab) (we all know how to make a PR at this
    point)

-   Start the ML model. (at least environment setup / ran through some
    examples) UI Framework: pick which ones to explore (tentatively)

Feb 27th

-   POCs for UI (technology review milestone)

-   Run ML on our own data.

Mar 6th:

-   UI integrate with our own model. UI filters demonstrated

Mar 13th:

-   Users tests

-   Upload new samples to model UI upload flow
