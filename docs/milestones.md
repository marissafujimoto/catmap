**Milestones:**

1.  Manipulate/filter data to better understand it. Make sure we understand annotations

2.  Start modeling for this dataset

3.  Demonstrate embedding models and test different ones

4.  Create basic plots to view the embedding

5.  Finalize the model

6.  Create a UI for the app Framework comparisons, see what fits the
    data best and looks most visually appealing

7.  Demonstrate that we can plot points in the UI (sanity test that all
    features are working)

8.  UI integrate with our own model. UI filters demonstrated

9.  Create a polished version of the plotted embedding

10. Test how well we can predict the mapping for a single user based on existing data

**Timeline (4 weeks (5-10 hours a week per person)):**

Feb 20th week:

-   Manipulate/filter data to better understand it

-   Make sure we feel good about additional annotations (more than just
    patient label)

-   Demonstrate embedding models and test different ones. Create basic plots to view the embeddings

-   Start the ML model. (at least environment setup / ran through some
    examples) UI Framework: pick which ones to explore (tentatively)

Feb 27th week:

-   Finalize the model. Run ML on our own data.

-   POCs for UI (technology review milestone)

-   Create a UI for the app Framework comparisons, see what fits the
    data best and looks most visually appealing

-   Demonstrate that we can plot points in the UI (sanity test that all
    features are working)

Mar 6th week:

-   UI integrate with our own model. UI filters demonstrated
  
-   Create a polished version of the plotted embedding

-   Test how well we can predict the mapping for a single user based on existing data

Mar 13th:

-   Users tests

-   Turn in final project

-   Upload new samples to model UI upload flow
